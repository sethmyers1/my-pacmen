# My Random Pacmen

### |Description|

This page generates PacMen at radom locations in the top left corner of the page. Once the game is started, they will move at different velocities within the confines of the screen.

### |Using This Tool|

Click "Add PacMan" to add as manu PacMen to the screen as you like. Once you have the desired amount of PacMen on the screen, click "Satrt Game" to move each of them at a random velocity on the screen

### |Support|

If you have any trouble with accessing the site or files, reach out via email to sethrmyers@gmail.com

### |The Future|

I plan to have the PacMen change color and the direction in which they are facing once contacting the barriers of the screen
